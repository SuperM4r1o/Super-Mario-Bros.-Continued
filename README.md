This is a project single-handedly created by Super Mario. This game was made for fun originally, but slowly became a more indept project of mine that i am now tirelessly working on. This game can feature challenges w/ mods, speedruns, TASes, and more. This is all being made in Mario Royale Legacy / Legacy Royale.
